# 🛒 E-Commerce Website 

A full-stack E-Commerce web application that allows users to browse products, add items to cart, place orders, and manage purchases.  
This project is built to demonstrate **strong fundamentals**, clean architecture, and real-world workflow — while still being **student-level and easy to understand**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Most beginner developers struggle to understand how real e-commerce platforms work internally — from product listing to checkout flow.  
This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a **simple yet realistic e-commerce system** that focuses on core concepts instead of over-engineering.
